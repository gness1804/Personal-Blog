		<h2>My New Cairn Terrier Site!</h2>
		<img src="images/puck.jpg" alt="My dog puck.">
		<p>Check out my <a href="http://ness-cairn-terriers.bitballoon.com/" target="_blank">new Cairn Terrier site!</a> It's a tribute to the dog breed coded from scratch. There's also a fun quiz where you can see how strong of a "fit" you are with a Cairn.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Made it to Denver!</h2>

		<p>I finally made it to Denver! It was a long 3-day drive, but I'm here. I'm excited for this new chapter and new start! <br /> <br /> The above photo is of my host's two Westies. They are a joy to be around and make me miss Mal (my cat) a bit less.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Charleston Wedding (May 21, 2016)</h2>
		<img src="images/charleston.jpeg" style="width: 350px;">
		<p>I had been meaning to post about this for a while, but never got around to it. I recently attended the beautiful wedding of my cousin, Bruce, to Darim, whom he met in the Army. It was a great event and a precious time for family to converge. <br><br> I was particularly happy to see my brother and mother there. I look forward to seeing the latter soon, when I return to Blacksburg! <br><br>  All best wishes to Bruce and Darim!</p><br><br>

		<h2>Home Cooked Food</h2>
		<img src="images/nia.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
		<p>I had a very nice dinner with my relatives, Carl and Donna. They sure know how to cook a chicken!
		We went on a nice nature walk and then had dinner. It will be a shame to leave them when I leave Florida.

Erik has been a good friend since 2008, when I met him through my good friend and roommate at the time. Erik is not only a stellar scholar and teacher but also a sweet guy and is richly deserving of this opportunity. Good luck, Erik!!</p><br><br>
