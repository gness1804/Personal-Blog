		<img src="images/charleston.jpeg" style="width: 350px;">
		<p>I had been meaning to post about this for a while, but never got around to it. I recently attended the beautiful wedding of my cousin, Bruce, to Darim, whom he met in the Army. It was a great event and a precious time for family to converge. <br><br> I was particularly happy to see my brother and mother there. I look forward to seeing the latter soon, when I return to Blacksburg! <br><br>  All best wishes to Bruce and Darim!</p>

		<p>I had a very nice dinner with my relatives, Carl and Donna. They sure know how to cook a chicken!
		We went on a nice nature walk and then had dinner. It will be a shame to leave them when I leave Floria.

		<p>Congratulations to my friend Erik, who will be an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.uco.edu/" target="blank">University of Central Oklahoma</a> starting in Fall 2016! Erik has been a good friend since 2008, when I met him through my good friend and roommate at the time. Erik is not only a stellar scholar and teacher but also a sweet guy and is richly deserving of this opportunity. Good luck, Erik!!</p>
