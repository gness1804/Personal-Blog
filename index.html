		<p>Congratulations to my friend Erik, who will be an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.uco.edu/" target="blank">University of Central Oklahoma</a> starting in Fall 2016! Erik has been a good friend since 2008, when I met him through my good friend and roommate at the time. Erik is not only a stellar scholar and teacher but also a sweet guy and is richly deserving of this opportunity. Good luck, Erik!!</p>

		<p>Congrats to my friend Dan, who will be teaching at the <a href="https://www.umflint.edu/" target="blank">University of Michigan-Flint</a> starting in the fall of 2016! I've known Dan since 2005, when we took a seminar together (remember Getting the Documents to Speak, Dan?). I am thrilled at his success and wish him and his family the best! </p>

		<h2>Home Cooked Food</h2>
		<img src="images/nia.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
		<p>I had a very nice dinner with my relatives, Carl and Donna. They sure know how to cook a chicken!
		We went on a nice nature walk and then had dinner. It will be a shame to leave them when I leave Floria.

		<h2>Charleston Wedding (May 21, 2016)</h2>
		<img src="images/charleston.jpeg" style="width: 350px;">
		<p>I had been meaning to post about this for a while, but never got around to it. I recently attended the beautiful wedding of my cousin, Bruce, to Darim, whom he met in the Army. It was a great event and a precious time for family to converge. <br><br> I was particularly happy to see my brother and mother there. I look forward to seeing the latter soon, when I return to Blacksburg! <br><br>  All best wishes to Bruce and Darim!</p>

		<h2>Made it to Denver!</h2>

		<p>I finally made it to Denver! It was a long 3-day drive, but I'm here. I'm excited for this new chapter and new start! <br /> <br /> The above photo is of my host's two Westies. They are a joy to be around and make me miss Mal (my cat) a bit less.</p>
