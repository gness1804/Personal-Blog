A Personal Blog

This is an attempt at a personal blog. Although I am fairly happy with the aesthetics and basic functionality, I need to devise a better way of adding entries. My present method, which involves adding new divs to the index page and re-calculating each div's position on the page, is much too cumbersome (and caused me to have to re-do the entire layout today). A better way to add entries to the home page would greatly facilitate keeping up with the blog.

**For new-layout branch: I switched the order of the blog posts such that they appear from least to most recent going down, which is the reverse of the old order. This makes it much less of a hassle to add new entries.
