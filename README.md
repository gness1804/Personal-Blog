A Personal Blog

This is a basic personal blog, formatted from the ground up. I include entries mostly on personal topics, though I have a political section that has yet to get off the ground.

Update: I significantly improved the layout of the entry divs in the index.html such that they are no longer dependent upon specified positions but still allow most recent to least recent flow of posts. Suggestions on how to further improve the blog are welcome!
