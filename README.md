A Personal Blog

This is an attempt at a personal blog. Although I am fairly happy with the aesthetics and basic functionality, I need to devise a better way of adding entries. My present method, which involves adding new divs to the index page and re-calculating each div's position on the page, is much too cumbersome (and caused me to have to re-do the entire layout today). A better way to add entries to the home page would greatly facilitate keeping up with the blog.
