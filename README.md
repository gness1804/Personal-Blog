##A Personal Blog

Superseded by [my updated version of the blog](https://github.com/gness1804/blog-in-react).

This is a basic personal blog, formatted from the ground up. I include entries on personal and professional topics. In particular, I am documenting my experiences with projects at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/), where I am a front-end engineering student.
