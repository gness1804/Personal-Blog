				JavaScript scopes are often the bane of both new and even many experienced JS developers, but it is critical to understand them well in order to write sound and functional JavaScript. In my own efforts to learn the principles of JS scope, I have found useful the metaphor of a nosy friend or neighbor who can't seem to mind his or her own business. (Hence the title of this post, the "M.Y.O.B." or "Mind Your Own Business" principle.) This has helped me to understand that since JS is function-scoped, each function "protects" variables created inside it from other parts of the code. This can seem quite abstract until one runs into what many developers call "variable pollution" or "global scope pollution", wherein global variables (those that are part of the entire document or global window object) can easily be unintentionally changed by any part of the code, since they are accessible by any function.<br><br>

				Let's start with an example. Let's say one is a part of a young childless (heterosexual) couple that has just moved into a new neighborhood, and an overly nosy neighbor can't stop pestering them about when they will have their first child. The <span class="myob-copy-italic">global</span> scope represents the space available to "Mike", the neighbor in question; he can access any variables not "protected" by a function. The couple in question, "Bill" and "Suzanne", create their own function to protect their own variables (information) from prying outsiders. (These is an entirely hypothetical example, by the way.)<br><br>

				So far, so good. Now let's say that the global variable (var) named "whenWillTheyHaveAChild" is equal to "I don't know." This is Mike's variable that he has access to because he "lives" in the global scope. Now suppose that Bill and Suzanne create an identically-named variable inside their private function, with the value of "We might not have kids for personal reasons." They of course don't want Mike or anyone not privy to their trusted circle knowing this, so the function value "We might not have kids due to personal preference" only exists within <span class="myob-copy-italic">their</span> function and cannot be accessed by outsiders. (If anyone outside of the couple's private function tries to use the variable called whenWillTheyHaveAChild, it will output "I don't know.")<br><br>

				Let's see the <a href="http://codepen.io/gness1804/pen/gwbOad" target="_blank">code</a> in action: <br><br>

				<textarea>
					<script>
				    var whenWillTheyHaveAChild = "I don't know";

				  function billAndSuzanneQuestion() {
				    var whenWillTheyHaveAChild = "We might not have kids due to personal preference";
				    console.log(whenWillTheyHaveAChild);
				      function closeFriendQuestion() {
				        console.log(whenWillTheyHaveAChild);
				      }
				      closeFriendQuestion(); //returns "We might not have kids due to personal preference" because the close friend has access to the var whenWillTheyHaveAChild created within the billAndSuzanneQuestion function
				  }



				  function mikeQuestion() {
				    console.log(whenWillTheyHaveAChild);
				  }

				mikeQuestion()
				//will return "I don't know" because this is a global variable; those who are in the global scope cannot access variables created within functions

				billAndSuzanneQuestion();
				//returns "We might not have kids due to personal preference" because this information is private, or protected, within the variable whenWillTheyHaveAChild created within the billAndSuzanneQuestion function

				closeFriendQuestion(); //returns an error message here because closeFriendQuestion is not contained within the global scope. Mike can't access the info that closeFriend has access to

				  </script>

			</textarea><br><br>

			Let's examine what's going on. As noted above, the global scope--the variables available to everyone--has the var whenWillTheyHaveAChild, which is set equal to "I don't know" because the outside world (i.e. prying neighbors like Mike) does know know when/if Bill and Suzanne will become parents, much as some like Mike would like to. But inside Bill's and Suzanne's private function, we can see the identically-named var is now equal to their own information. When we call the mikeQuestion function, which references the global scope, we get back "I don't know", but when we call the billAndSuzanneQuestion function, we see their private information, "We might not have kids due to personal preference". Mike and Suzanne certainly don't want to advertise to the world the sensitive details of their potential parental status, and thanks to JavaScript scoping, they don't have to!<br><br>

			Let's take this one step further. Now let's suppose that our couple has a very close friend with whom they share some personal information such as their potential plans to be parents or not. We can create a function called closeFriendQuestion <span>within</span> the original billAndSuzanneQuestion function. In JavaScript, functions created within other functions have access to the variables of outer functions (this is the core of a JS concept called <span class="myob-copy-italic">closure</span>; see this useful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp" target="_blank">summary</a> of closure for more information.) Thanks to closure, the closeFriend has access to the information contained in the couple's whenWillTheyHaveAChild var, but those outside the function do not. You can see this demonstrated in the code above.

			I hope this example made some sense of JS closure and scoping! Much like questions surrounding jurisdiction in the law (so I've been told, anyway), issues regarding JS scope torment newbies and sometimes vex even experienced professionals. But if one keeps in mind the concept of functions protecting private variables, such as our example of keeping prying neighbors from accessing sensitive personal information, this might bring some clarity to the equation.
