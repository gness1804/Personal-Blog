			<h2>Number Guesser Project with Kinan Whyte</h2>

			<h4 class="myob-copy-italic">See this on <a href="https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser" target="_blank">Github,</a> and try it out <a href="https://kswhyte.github.io/number-guesser/" target="_blank">live</a>.</h4>
			<p>
				I constructed a <a href="https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser" target="_blank">number guesser program </a> with colleague Kinan Whyte during Module 1 at the <a href="https://www.turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software and Design</a>, where I am a front-end engineering student. We created a program with basic functionality, albeit with a few hiccups. Our program accepts a number from the user (default range 0-100) and generates a pseudo-random number which it compares to the user's number. The program tells the user whether his/her number is too low, too high, out of the acceptable range, or not a number (such as text). If the user correctly guesses the computer's number, the program regenerates another pseudo-random value and adjusts the max and min by +10 and -10 respectively. The program also accepts optional max and min values from the user. Upon user submission of these values, the program regenerates a pseudo-random within the new range. <br><br>

				Our main accomplishment was constructing an interactive quantitative program that responds to user input. We used JavaScript, CSS, and of course HTML in building this program. Kinan did most of the CSS and I wrote much of the JavaScript (though Kinan also made some crucial contributions in the latter area). We employed the Atom text editor to complete the project and made use of online resources such as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random" target="_blank">random number generator from MDN</a> (the third from the top on the linked page), which was the basis for our number generator.<br><br>

				We learned a great deal from this project. We both significantly improved our JavaScript skills, particularly in the areas of interactions between functions, structuring a JavaScript page, and refactoring JS to make it more readable and logically organized. The major snags we confronted were struggles to fix parts of the program that one of us had "broken" in revisions and attempting to make the program store the pseudo-random number during sessions while also resetting it when the user wins or hits the "reset" button, which returns the game to its default state (we also included a "clear" button to clear the input box). We successfully worked through these challenges with the invaluable assistance of colleagues and teachers at Turing.<br><br>

				I also gained important experience in team collaboration, as this was my first partnered  programming project. Overall, this was an important educational experience that I will build on in the future.
